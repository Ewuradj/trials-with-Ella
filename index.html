        <h2>5 Things I Learned About <br> Leadership From the Death & <br> Rebirth of Microsoft</h2>
        <p>I was at Microsoft from 2002 until 2019 and pretty much agreed that Microsoft was essentially dead as an innovative tech company in 2007.<br> Under Steve Ballmer, the CEO at the time, the company was good at extracting money and building software for business customers.<br> However the company also tried and failed to build any compelling products in every new space it tried.</p>

        <p>Everyone at the company was encouraged to try new things, learn from failure and refuse to be complacent.<br> Satya led by example here by changing a number of ways we did business as the company had become stuck in its ways.<br>This was a transformative cultural change that started at the top but was felt by every individual team at the company.</p>
